# Message

The message component represents a message sent by a user.

## Default

<Story name="Default" args={{ message: message }}>
  {Template.bind({})}
</Story>

<ArgsTable story="Default" />

## Is My Message

You can set the `isMyMessage` prop to `true` and the message will appear to be sent by you.

This involves significantly changing the style and position of the message.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Is My Message" args={{ message: message, isMyMessage: true }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With Attachments

If the `message` props has files in its `attachments` field, then files and images will be rendered accordingly.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Attachments" args={{ message: messagePlusAttachments }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Show Date Time

You can set the `showDateTime` prop to `true` and the message will appear under the date-time it was created at.

The date-time value pulls from the `message` prop's `created` value.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Show Date Time" args={{ message: message, showDateTime: true }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Is Sending

You can set the `isSending` prop to `true` and the message will appear to be sending.

This is for messages which have not delivered yet.

This should only be set when `isMyMessage` is `true`. This is because non-delivered messages are only visible to you, inherently.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Is Sending"
    args={{
      message: messagePlusAttachments,
      isSending: true,
      isMyMessage: true,
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Between Messages

When you put a message between two others with `lastMessage` and `nextMessage` props, then you get sharper borders on the outside.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Between Messages"
    args={{
      lastMessage: message,
      message: message,
      nextMessage: message,
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Read Message

If you pass in the optional `chat` prop and the `people` attribute shows users have read this message, dots will appear accordingly.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Read Message"
    args={{
      message: message,
      chat: chatReadMessage,
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
